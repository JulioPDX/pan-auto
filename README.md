# Configuring a PAN Firewall with the pan-os-python SDK

Thank you for checking out this repository. What you see here is a collection of my learnings working through the PAN Python SDK and Craig Stansburys course on Pluralsight (great course). I hope this gives you an idea of what is possible and maybe start automating some firewall configurations.

## Getting Started

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/JulioPDX/pan-auto.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Modify

At this point feel free to modify the code or use the examples as reference to build out anything you want!

## Blog

If you have some spare time or just curious, feel free to read through the blog post referencing this repository.
